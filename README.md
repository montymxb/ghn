# ghn

Github notifications in Go, Leveraging `gh`.

This is a simple github notification utility to list all notifications. Originally I was looking into `gh` to do this, but it lacked the ability to show all notifications so that they could be read _without_ using the Github site.

This tool then allows you to quickly read previews of notifications, mark notifications as read, or open them up on Github directly.
